# Question: How do you find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree? JavaScript Summary

The provided JavaScript code defines a solution for finding the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree. The code first defines a Node class for creating nodes, and a BinaryTree class for creating a binary tree. The BinaryTree class includes a method called findLowestCommonAncestor, which takes the root of the tree and two nodes as arguments. This method uses a recursive approach to traverse the tree. It first checks if the current node is one of the two nodes we are looking for. If it is, the method returns the current node. If it's not, the method recursively checks the left and right subtrees. If both subtrees return a node, it means that each of the two nodes is in a different subtree, so the current node is their lowest common ancestor. If only one subtree returns a node, it means that both nodes are in the same subtree, so the method returns the node found in that subtree. The code then creates a binary tree and uses the findLowestCommonAncestor method to find and print the lowest common ancestors of different pairs of nodes.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is very similar to the JavaScript version in terms of logic and structure. Both versions use a recursive approach to traverse the binary tree and find the lowest common ancestor. The main difference lies in the use of TypeScript's static typing feature.

In the TypeScript version, types are explicitly declared for variables and function return values. For instance, the `Node` class properties `value`, `left`, and `right` are typed as `number`, `Node | null`, and `Node | null` respectively. The `BinaryTree` class property `root` is typed as `Node | null`. The `findLowestCommonAncestor` method parameters `root`, `value1`, and `value2` are typed as `Node | null`, `number`, and `number` respectively, and the return type is `Node | null`.

This use of static typing helps to catch potential type-related errors at compile time, making the code more robust and less prone to runtime errors. It also makes the code more readable and maintainable, as the types of variables and function return values are clear at a glance.

Another minor difference is in the way the result is logged to the console. The TypeScript version uses a template literal to log the result, which is a more modern and flexible way to concatenate strings and variables in JavaScript and TypeScript.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses a similar approach to the JavaScript version. Both versions use recursion to traverse the binary tree and find the lowest common ancestor. They both check if the current node is one of the two nodes. If it is, they return the current node. If not, they check the left and right subtrees. If both subtrees return a node, it means that one node is in the left subtree and the other is in the right subtree, so the current node is the lowest common ancestor. If only one subtree returns a node, it means that both nodes are in that subtree, so they return the node found.

However, there are some differences due to the language features and syntax of C++ and JavaScript:

1. In C++, we use `struct` to define the Node structure, while in JavaScript, we use `class`. 

2. In C++, we use pointers (`Node*`) to refer to nodes, while in JavaScript, we use object references.

3. In C++, we use a helper function `newNode` to create new nodes, while in JavaScript, we use the `new` keyword with the constructor of the `Node` class.

4. In C++, we use `NULL` to represent a null pointer, while in JavaScript, we use `null`.

5. In C++, we use the `cout` statement to print the result, while in JavaScript, we use `console.log`.

6. In C++, we use the `main` function as the entry point of the program, while in JavaScript, the code is executed from top to bottom.

7. In C++, we use the `return 0;` statement to indicate that the program has finished successfully, while in JavaScript, we don't need to do this.
